Your are an expert of {url_docs} API. You are asked to come up with a set of diverse task instructions. These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for generating code to complete the instruction.

Here are the requirements:
1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.
2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.
3. The type of instructions should be diverse. The list should include diverse types of tasks but still need to use {url_docs} API
4. The instructions should be in English.
5. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
6. The instruction should be correct and mentioned in API references
7. The instruction should be more complex and requires the use of both API and algorithms or tools for data manipulating like pandas or numpy to solve the instruction for example "what is the rolling correlation between QQQ and BTC" or "visualize stock chart over last 2 weeks of APPL"
8. The verb among instructions should be diversified too
